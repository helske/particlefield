## Sequential Monte Carlo for latent Gaussian Markov random fields

This `R` package contains supplementary material for paper "Sequential Monte Carlo for probabilistic graphical models via twisted targets" by Lindsten, Helske, Vihola (2018).

The package contains functions for finding Gaussian approximation for Binomial CAR model, bootstrap particle filter and twisted SMC algorithms for latent field and likelihood estimation as well as delayed acceptance MCMC based on Gaussian approximation + SMC.
